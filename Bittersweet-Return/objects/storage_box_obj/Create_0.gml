// Photo Album

alternateText1[1] = "Baby photos, birthdays, graduation ceremonies that aren't mine, old relatives, puppies..."
alternateText1[2] = "There's a section dedicated to Jaad, like pages and pages of it."
alternateText1[3] = "He looks a lot younger, with more weight, in a hockey uniform that's way too big on him."
alternateText1[4] = "Another one, this time a photo of him graduating from High School. He's SERIOUSLY buff!"

alternateText2[1] = "It's not something I really got into, my dad plays so he just kind of forced me into it."
alternateText2[2] = "Haven't really played in years, sports were never really my thing, like, AT ALL!"
alternateText2[3] = "I ended up stopping because I found hobbies I actually liked, like theater and track."
alternateText2[4] = "I wish I put more enthusiasm into it though, he really tried to show me something he liked."
alternateText2[5] = "Little me just did not care for it though. The court was way too hot."

// Gun

alternateText3[2] = "It's some really old antique from the late 13th century my parents got as a wedding gift."
alternateText3[3] = "The reason it's not on display is because it's not a gift any of them like really."
alternateText3[4] = "It kind of just sits here trying to blend in and pretend to be a tube."

// Ending Text
